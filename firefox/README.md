# Firefox
This is a roughly tested Firefox version of the chrome extension. Some slight modifications made to how the player js gets loaded due to unknown Firefox-specific errors in the handling of the original use of "new Function(playerJs);" and url redirects.

# Installing

Download "twitchadblock-1.0-an+fx.xpi" and drag it into firefox. When you see the pop-up to add the extension press "Add".

If the above doesn't work then go to "about:addons" and then click the cog icon. In the drop down menu select "Install Add-on From File..." and navigate to the downloaded extension file.

Thanks to https://github.com/BradyThe for packaging and signing the extension.
